All the kool kids are doing it. The newest languages and tools have (semi-)standard project layouts. C and C++? No such a thing.

Eh... I'm sure there are projects out there unique enough to warrant
very... unique... layouts. I would contend that they are few and far
between, especially for libraries. Most projects have a few components:

- The public headers
- The library's compilable source files
- The private headers
- Executable entry points (`main.cpp` files)
- Documentation
- Tests
- External libraries that have been nested within the project structure
- Build files

What are we to do other than throw these things all over the place in
hopes that we end up with some semblance of sanity?

# A Sane Project Structure

The C++ community has been slowly converging, whether from network
effects, or independent discovery of similar sane project structures.
We're due for some kind of convention. Not an ISO standard, mind you:
Just an informal, de-facto standard.

I'm going to write here what I think can be a good candidate as the
de-facto standard.

I didn't conceive of this structure all on my own. I've learned and
adapted to what I've seen in the wild: What works, what doesn't, and what
is truly irrelevant.

## Starting from the Top!

- **Repository**: At the top of the project structure you will have your
  repository, of course! The `.git`, `.svn`, `.hg`, or whatever else you
  might have.
- **The `build` Directory**: In your repository's ignored files will
  always be `build/`. This is an extremely common subdirectory used for
  building the source tree. It should not contain any files checked in or
  modified as part of the main codebase. The presence or absence of the
  file should not have a significant effect on the project's behavior.
- **Your root build files**: `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `SConstruct`,
  `build.sh`, or whatever you might have. Always at the root! Never in a
  subdirectory!
- A `README` file, any format.
- A `LICENSE` file, as a plaintext file with the license text.
- The following **subdirectories** may or may not be present, as
  necessary:
  - `include/`
  - `src/`
  - `test/`
  - `util/`
  - `extras/`
  - `third_party/`
  - `doc/`
  - `res/`
  - `examples/`
  - `cmake/` (CMake only)
- You may also have tool configuration files, such as `.clang-format`,
  `.clang-tidy`, `.gitignore`, `.hgignore`, and similar.

Now for each subdirectory:

## Subdirectory: `cmake/`

This directory is only required if you are using CMake and have
additional modules or toolchain files.

In this directory, place `FindFoo.cmake` find-modules, `Foo.cmake` CMake
modules, `MyToolchain.cmake` toolchain files, `ConfigSomething.cmake`
cache-init files, and subdirectories required to support them. At the top
of your `CMakeLists.txt`, **before your call to `project()`**, place this
line:

```cmake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
```

This will ensure that the `cmake/` subdirectory is included in the CMake
module search path.

## Subdirectory: `third_party/`

If you embed and distribute external projects in your source structure,
place them in here. **Each external dependency should receive its own
subdirectory.**

For example, to embed *Catch2* for testing, a subdirectory `third_party/Catch2`
will appear. In there will be the code for the embedded library.

### CMake User Notes:

Add a `third_party/CMakeLists.txt` to the project structure. Call
`add_subdirectory(third_party)` from your root `CMakeLists.txt`.

If an external library supports using `add_subdirectory()` on it, add a
call to `add_subdirectory()` in the `third_party/CMakeLists.txt` for that
project.

If a project _does not_ support CMake embedding, or you prefer to import
the dependency in a different manner, for a dependency `FooPackage`,
write a `third_party/FooPackage.cmake` file that does the import, and
`include(FooPackage.cmake)` from the `third_party/CMakeLists.txt`.

**DO NOT MODIFY EMBEDDED EXTERNAL PROJECTS BEYOND WHAT IS _NECESSARY_**.

## Subdirectory: `extras/`

This contains "add-ons" to the main source code. These might be components that
require special dependencies, or components that are not necessary for the
building of the main project. A library consumer should have the option to
enable/disable these components as necessary at build time. Each component
must occupy another subdirectory of `extras/` with an appropriate name.

Each subdirectory of `extras/` should also have its own project structure
mirroring the layout proposed in this document.

This directory is entirely optional.

### CMake User Notes:

Add a `extras/CMakeLists.txt`. Unconditionally `add_subdirectory(extras)` from
the root `CMakeLists.txt`.

The `extras/CMakeLists.txt` file should contain the relevant cache
variable/option declarations for enabling/disabling each subcomponent.

After each enablement option should be a conditional
`add_subdirectory(<foo>)` for the corresponding `extras/<foo>`
subdirectory.

For example, if you have a project structure like this:

```
<root>/
  CMakeLists.txt
  extras/
    CMakeLists.txt
    foo/
    bar/
    baz/
```

then the `extras/CMakeLists.txt` might look like this:

```cmake
# Optionally enable the `foo` extension
option(BUILD_FOO "Build the 'foo' extension" ON)
# Include if they requested it:
if(BUILD_FOO)
    add_subdirectory(foo)
endif()

# They can chose either `bar` or `baz`, or disable it with `none`
set(EXTRA_THING_MODE "none"
    CACHE STRING
    "The mode for the extra thing [none, bar, baz]"
    )
# Declare the options for the cache value:
set_property(CACHE EXTRA_THING_MODE PROPERTY STRINGS none bar baz)

# Include the mode they requested:
if(EXTRA_THING_MODE STREQUAL "bar")
    add_subdirectory(bar)
elseif(EXTRA_THING_MODE STREQUAL "baz")
    add_subdirectory(baz)
elseif(EXTRA_THING_MODE STREQUAL "none")
    # Nothing. It is disabled
else()
    message(WARNING "Unexpected EXTRA_THING_MODE: '${EXTRA_THING_MODE}'")
endif()
```

<div class="admonition" markdown="1">
# Lookout!

**Nothing** from the main source tree should depend on a `extras/`, but
an `extras/` sub-project may depend on other `extras/` sub-projects.
</div>

## Subdirectory: `util/`

This directory contains scripts and utilities that are "meta" to the project.
This might include turn-key build scripts, linting scripts, code-generation
scripts, test scripts, or whatever else might be useful to a developer working
on the project. This is not part of the external-facing user interface for the
project.

## Subdirectory: `test/`

This is what it says on the tin: Tests. This document does not prescribe a
specific structure for this subdirectory. Just put your tests here.

### CMake User Notes:

Add a `test/CMakeLists.txt` file and **conditionally** `add_subdirectory(test)`
toward the end of your root `CMakeLists.txt`.

**DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY INCLUDE THIS DIRECTORY.**

The condition should be the logical conjunction of two things: A `BUILD_TESTING`
option (the CMake convention) and whether
`PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR STREQUAL CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.

Your root `CMakeLists.txt` should look something like this:

```cmake
project(MyProject VERSION 1.0.0)

# ...

option(BUILD_TESTING "Build the testing tree" ON)
if(BUILD_TESTING AND (PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR STREQUAL CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR))
    enable_testing()
    add_subdirectory(test)
endif()
```

The `BUILD_TESTING` option is the standard way in CMake to enable/disable the
building of tests. Don't call `enable_testing()` unless this option is enabled.

The check `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR STREQUAL CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` is a check that your
project is the _root project_. If your project is included in someone else's
project via `add_subdirectory()`, this check will fail and your tests will not
be added to the includer's tests.

## Subdirectory: `examples/`

If you generate a library (or a program that might benefit from examples), they
should be placed here. The structure of this directory isn't prescribed by this
document.

### CMake User Notes

Just like with `test/`, this directory should contain a `CMakeLists.txt` and
its inclusion be optional:

```cmake
project(MyProject VERSION 1.0.0)

# ...

option(BUILD_EXAMPLES "Build examples" ON)
if(BUILD_EXAMPLES AND (PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR STREQUAL CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR))
    add_subdirectory(examples)
endif()
```

## Subdirectory: `include/`

If you separate between private and public headers, the `include/` directory
should contain your _public headers_. That is, the headers which are needed by
your library consumers. If you are not shipping a library to consumers, or all
of your headers are public (you have no private headers), this directory is
optional.

If you want to ship headers, but do not have a private/public header
distinction, put all of your headers in the `src/` directory.

### CMake User Notes:

This directory _does not_ contain a `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Subdirectory: `src/`

This should contain all of the source files for the project, other than those in `include/`, if any.

If you have separate private and public headers, place private headers in this
directory. If you do not have any private headers, you may place headers in this
directory.

Always place header files alongside their respective source file, if applicable.

If you merge sources and public headers together in this directory, install
rules can install the content of this directory to `include/`, excluding any
non-header files in the install. This can be achieved by matching the header
filename using a globbing expression.

### Note

Check below on the subject of `src/` and `include/` structure.
</div>

### CMake User Notes:

This directory will contain a top-level `src/CMakeLists.txt`, but shouldn't
contain any subdirectory CMake list files. The `src/CMakeLists.txt` should
declare and define the libraries/executables that will be built for the project.

## Subdirectory: `doc/`

This directory should contain documentation for the project. The documentation
engine and methodology is not defined by this document.

## Subdirectory: `res/`

This directory should contain other resources used by the project, such as
icons and graphics. These are usually not edited as code, but by another
external program.

## Source and Header File Layout

C++ has the concept of namespaces. C doesn't have namespaces, but it is
conventional to prefix function and type names with a namespace to avoid name
collision and ambiguity. These concepts are roughly equivalent for the purposes
of this document.

Header files should either mirror or _closely resemble_ the namespace structure
of the project. This is only partially for developers: It is useful for
consumers to understand where their `#include`s will resolve.

Detail/implementation namespaces aren't necessary to represent in the directory
structure.

As an example, if we have a library call `vob-json` with a type called
`vob::json`, the file structure might look like:

```
<root>/
  {include,src}/
    vob/
      json.hpp
      [json.cpp]
```

The `include/` (and/or `src/`) directory will be added to the include path for
the project and consuming projects. This means `vob-json` users will use:

```c++
#include <vob/json.hpp>
```

to consume the project.

This correspondence between namespaces and header structure allows users to
easily understand and cross-correlate between `#include` path and namespace
path. This is also useful for new developers as the location of a project
component is easily locatable in this structure.

**DO NOT place headers at the root of `include/` or `src/`**, except for
posisbly a single "include everything" header for the case of simple libraries.

This structure is also easy to install as the `include/` (or `src/`) directories
can be installed directly without rearranging the files, and both the library
itself and external consumers will see the same directory structure when using
your project.

## CMake Notes

It was mentioned above that there should only be one `CMakeLists.txt` in the
`src/` tree, and that it should not call `add_subdirectory()`. This is for the
same purpose as outlined above: The source file paths should correspond to the
namespace structure, and the source file paths used in `add_library()` and
`add_executable()` should match the paths passed when using `#include` in source
files.

## Subcomponents (Hint: Don't)

Do not include more than one library in the same `src/` and `include/` tree!

It is not recommended for most projects to use subcomponents and multiple
linkable libraries. Subcomponent management is fraught with peril. Prefer
instead to create a single global library and have users linked to that. If you
generate a static library, the linker will discard object files from your
static library that are not being used by the end result. This means that there
is no space efficiency lost for using the single global library, and it makes
the usage interface for user developers very easy when they only need to link
in a single library.

Even still, it may be useful for some large frameworks and libraries to be able
to subdivide themselves into smaller chunks, especially if different
subcomponents are optional or have dependencies that may or may not be present.

If your project has subcomponents, create a `libs/` directory, and for each
subcomponent `<foo>` create a `libs/<foo>` subdirectory. Within this
subdirectory include another project structure roughly resembling the
structure described in this document.

For example, if I have a `vob-serialization` library that has JSON, XML, and
YAML subcomponents, my source tree might look like this:

```
<root>
  CMakeLists.txt
  third_party/
  libs/
    CMakeLists.txt
    json/
      CMakeLists.txt
      test/
      src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        vob/
          json.hpp
          json.cpp
    xml/
      CMakeLists.txt
      test/
      src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        vob/
          xml.hpp
          xml.cpp
    yaml/
      CMakeLists.txt
      test/
      src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        vob/
          yaml.hpp
          yaml.cpp
```

Each subcomponent has a mini-project in its `libs/` directory. Each
`CMakeLists.txt` defines a single library for that subcomponent, and that
library adds the local `src/` directory to its include path.

### Why?

The primary motivation for keeping subcomponents separate is to ensure that
usage and division are clearly defined.

If _all_ headers and sources live together in a single `include/` or `src/`
directory, then _all_ headers will be visible to the user when they link to any
of the libraries living in that source tree.

For example, if a user links to `vob::json` for the JSON subcomponent of the
example library, I do not want them to be able to `#include <vob/xml.hpp>`. If
they were to include this file and try to call any functions within, they would
end up with linker errors.

In a similar sense, the headers for each subcomponent should also be
_installed_ to distinct directories. This means that your headers _should not_
be installed to a single `/usr/include` or similar.

## Other Rules for Project Structure

> Do not generate source files within the source tree, only the build tree.

Keeping the source tree clean of generated files is essential. It leaves no room
for ambiguity between generated and hand-made source files. If you must generate
headers, generate them in the build tree and add the generated directory to
your include path.

> When installing, _do not_ install to global directories.

Installing to global directories prevents users from installing multiple
versions of your project side-by-side.

Instead, install your linkable libraries and headers to a directory qualified
by the name and version of the project.

For example, if I have `vob-database` at version `1.2.1`, the install tree
would look something like this:

```
<prefix>/
  lib/
    vob-database-1.2.1/
      include/
        vob/
          database.hpp
      lib/
        libvob-database.a
      cmake/
        vob-databaseConfig.cmake
        vob-databaseConfigVersion.cmake
```

The imported targets from `vob-database` will add the proper include directories
such that the user need not worry about the paths above.

This also lends itself well to doing user-mode installs. If the above tree were
to be installed via `sudo make install`, then all the installed files would
appear in `/usr/local/lib/vob-database-1.2.1`, giving the user an easy to
understand way to remove the install files if they wish, rather than splatting
and mixing the files around with whatever else may be present in `/usr/local`.
